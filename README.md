### Project Title
Exploring US Bikeshare Data

### Description
This project includes a program that demonstrates how python code can interact with a user and perform statistical functions with the "pandas" and "time" packages.  

First, the program allows the user to select data from one of three cities, then filter it further by date and time.  

Second, the program asks the user if they would like to see five lines of raw data and if they would like to see more.

Third, the program performs four statistical functions.

Finally, the user may restart or exit the program.
